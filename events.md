##### Webinar and discussion: 
### Development in Context

This webinar, moderated by Candica Koolhaas *(University of Massachusetts Boston)*, brings together invited speakers to highlight the role of contexts and environments in shaping research on development. Speakers will showcase the methods their labs employ to capture environmental variables and discuss the insights they have uncovered from these approaches.

* **Dr. Jessica Kosie** *(Arizona State University)* will discuss how her lab collects data on the early speech environment and how it interacts with cultural and socioeconomic differences. 
* **Dr. Tess Forest** *(Columbia University)* will introduce methods for measuring caregiver unpredictability in naturalistic interactions and discuss how it relates to infants’ attention and learning. 
* **Dr. Zuzanna Ludanska**, *(Polish Academy of Sciences)* will talk about using wearables to study infant vocalizations, and what it can tell us about how naturalistic infant behavior changes in daily situational contexts.
* **Dr. Peter Krøjgaard** *(Aarhus University)* will demonstrate how his lab collects data on the day-to-day life of young children via take-home diaries, as well as the insights it can provide about children’s environments and some of the best-practices for the method.

#### June 25, 2025 - 14:00-15:30 UTC (10am EDT) on Zoom
##### Panel Discussion: 
### Rethinking Infant Looking Time: Models, Methods, and Large-Scale Collaboration
#### Anjie Cao, *Stanford University*
#### Ingmar Visser, *University of Amsterdam*
#### Martin Zettersten, *University of California, San Diego*

This panel explores how researchers study infant attention by measuring where and how long babies look. Anjie Cao presents a new model, RANCH, that treats looking as a form of decision-making under uncertainty. By analyzing large datasets from both infants and adults, the model helps capture patterns of habituation and dishabituation. Interestingly, the findings challenge the common idea that infants prefer familiar things. Anjie discusses how formal models can strengthen the interpretation of looking-time data. Ingmar Visser focuses on what eye-tracking can reveal about visual attention in infancy. He presents results from free-viewing studies that examine which factors shape infant visual attention and how these patterns change during the first year of life. Ingmar uses a model called WALD-EM to describe how infants gather visual information over time, capturing looking behavior as a gradual accumulation of evidence. Martin Zettersten draws on findings from large collaborative projects, such as ManyBabies and <a href="https://peekbank.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Peekbank</a>, which combine data from multiple labs to better understand looking-time measures. These datasets are valuable not only for testing theories about infant cognition but also for evaluating how reliable and informative our current measurement approaches are. Martin prompts discussion around what we still do not know about infant looking-time measures and what future projects (like <a href="https://manybabies.org/MB5/" target="_blank">ManyBabies 5</a>!) might help clarify.

### Workshop: Multiverse Analyses
#### Giulia Calignano, *Università degli Studi di Padova*

In this workshop on Multiverse Analyses, Giulia introduces attendees to the multiverse concept and why it matters--especially in multilab contexts--and discuss how the multiverse approach addresses researcher degrees of freedom across labs. She then goes over how the <a href="https://manybabies.org/MB2P/" target="_blank">MB2P (Pupillometry)</a> spin-off project is implementing a multiverse analysis approach using the data from the main <a href="https://manybabies.org/MB2/" target="_blank">MB2</a> study.

### Panel discussion: Piloting for developmental science

Piloting is a necessary part of sound experimental design, and it is especially important when the participants are young children and high drop-out rates are of particular concern. We held a panel discussion about piloting in developmental science with a focus on early childhood. Topicsinclude: What are the goals of piloting? What are some piloting ‘best practices’? How should piloting efforts be documented/reported? What are the specific challenges of piloting studies with young participants?

### Workshop: Preregistration: The nudge you need to preregister your next project
#### Zsuzsa Kaldy, *University of Massachusetts Boston*

This talk is for developmental researchers at all levels of training who know that they should be preregistering their projects, but for various reasons have not started doing it yet. Dr. Kaldy goes over the theoretical reasons behind the need for preregistration, and then focuses on why the benefits outweigh the perceived costs and how she has dealt with those in her lab. She also shares some practical tips about how to write an optimal preregistration and how to deal with the (largely inevitable) deviations from the plan. The talk is followed by an open Q&A.

### Behavioral coding software for developmental science:
### An overview of BORIS, Datavyu, and ELAN

Behavioral coding software streamlines the process of analyzing infant behavior by providing tools to record, categorize, and measure observational data. It allows researchers to precisely capture and quantify complex behaviors, thus enabling deeper insights into infant development. In this 90-minute webinar hosted by Nicolás Alessandroni and Brianna McMillan, we hear from representatives of <a href="https://www.boris.unito.it/" target="_blank">BORIS</a>, <a href="https://datavyu.org/" target="_blank">Datavyu</a>, and <a href="https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan" target="_blank">ELAN</a>, who showcase each software’s main features and possibilities. Following the presentations, there is a Q&A and discussion on potential applications in infant research. Take advantage of this chance to discover how these tools can enhance your research!

**Thank you to Marco Gamba from BORIS, Kasey Soska from Databrary, and Divya Kanekal & Han Sloetjes from ELAN for participating!**

### Workshop: Power analysis
#### Christopher Cox, *Aarhus University*

Presenter Christopher M. M. Cox (Aarhus University) leads an interactive workshop on power analysis. The workshop includes both theoretical and practical components. In the theoretical component, he discusses why to conduct power analyses, how to incorporate information from previous studies, and why we should construe power analyses as useful opportunities to think through the design dynamics of a study.

The practical component includes an R tutorial on how to conduct simulation-based power analyses for linear mixed-effects models (and possible extensions to GLMMS). To gain practical experience in how to simulate data and run power analyses, you can work through the provided tutorial using an up-to-date R version (4 or above) and RStudio (version 1.3 or above). If you do not have experience with R, you can still get a lot out of the workshop and will be able to follow along, as all code and code output are available at the link below.

### Webinar: Open data for developmental science
#### Christina Bergmann, *Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences & Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics*

Open data is one of the key mandates in calls for increased transparency, with badges, citation advantages, and sometimes even refusal to publish papers when data are not made open. For developmental researchers, this need for transparency stands in stark contrast with confidentiality, especially when working with infants. Christina reviews developmental science's impressive history of open data to show that there are ways to ethically and responsibly share data, and then discusses different strategies and emerging best practices to balance participant protection with transparency.

### Webinar: An introduction to open science
#### Nicolás Alessandroni & Krista Byers-Heinlein, *Concordia University*

In this workshop, Nicolás and Krista introduce the open science perspective for psychological research. The aim is for participants to discover, discuss, and engage in using open science practices (e.g., open access, open data, preprints, pre-registration) and to learn ways to apply them in their own research. The workshop does not require prior knowledge of open science; all those interested in learning or deepening their knowledge of how to do open research are most welcome!
