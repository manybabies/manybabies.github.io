<!--
To-do:
- replace image placeholders.
- Add high resolution plot.

Suggestion:
- Esther suggestion: "It would be cool to highlight the numbers a bit more on the   mb 1 page – maybe a “project at a glance” element with 69 labs, XY babies, etc etc. I’m thinking of something like this: https://attalitech.com/ The second element on there with “Services include” has columns that could be used to highlight numbers."; github repository for attali website: https://github.com/daattali/attalitech

Notes:
- add img html syntax:
  <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/avatar-icon_placeholder.png">
  for in-text images, use imgs with max of 250pix; it will be alligned with the following paragraph

In the first **ManyBabies** project, we replicated a robust finding from developmental literature: infants’ preference for infant-directed speech (IDS) over adult-directed speech (ADS). IDS is characterized by a higher pitch, greater pitch excursions, and shorter utterances when compared to ADS. <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/ILL.photoshot.baby.in.booth.jpeg"> Exposure to IDS has been shown to improve word segmentation and word learning. We asked if infants have a preference for IDS, and how this preference varies across age, native language background, and method.

Sixty-nine labs, summing 2,329 infants (range: 3-15 months-old) from 16 countries participated. We focused on three primary methods for assessing infants’ interest: single-screen central fixation, eye tracking, and the head-turn preference procedure (HPP). We had a great time. 

We confirmed the existence of an IDS preference in infant listeners. We also found that it increases across development (magnitude of 0.05 SDs per month), suggesting a modulation by experience, maturation, or both. We found a preference for North America English (NAE) IDS even among participants whose native language or dialect was not NAE.

Lastly, we found a stronger effect with the HPP than with the central-fixation or eye-tracking approaches. This engagement might be linked to the greater effort required by HPP.
