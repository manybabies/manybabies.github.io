*We are thrilled to announce that our newest ManyBabies project is...*

## [ManyBabies7: Curiosity]({{site.baseurl}}/MB7/)

This project will examine how factors such as novelty, surprise, and uncertainty drive infants’ curiosity and exploration choices across cultures and methodologies.

A small group of interested researchers has already been developing ideas, and we are now seeking broader input to shape the core research question and study design! Join our upcoming Zoom planning workshops to hear about the current vision and help refine the direction of this new ManyBabies endeavor. All are welcome to attend!!
