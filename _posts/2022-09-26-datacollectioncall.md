Three MB studies (MB2, MB3, and MB4) are beginning data collection and are looking for interested labs to help! 

All developmental labs are invited to join the data collection efforts of one or more project(s). Subject-area expertise is NOT required to collect data for a project, and all study materials and protocols will be provided.

More information about each study (e.g., age range, method) as well as links to sign up are available [**HERE**](https://mailchi.mp/8aea6ae72df2/collect-data-with-manybabies-updated-jan23).
