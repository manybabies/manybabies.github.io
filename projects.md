The broader goals of ManyBabies come together in a set of collaborative projects. This page gives an (incomplete) overview of past and major ongoing ManyBabies projects, and [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1esnJTsPB0NJ2PP0fwmWIhSxShKLIN99Ga8ehCDyz3rQ/edit?usp=sharing) provides more complete list our different activities and initiatives.

## ManyBabies Theory Paper

A statement of our broader goals as a group, available at [https://psyarxiv.com/27b43/](https://psyarxiv.com/27b43/).

## MB1: Infant-Directed Speech Preference

Topic: Do infants have a preference for infant-directed speech? How does this preference vary across age, method, and native language background?

Leads: Michael Frank and Melanie Soderstrom

Status: Completed.

Links: [Project with Materials, Protocols, and Documentation](https://osf.io/re95x/). [Listserv](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/manybabies1). [Data and Code on Github](https://github.com/manybabies/mb1-analysis-public). 

### MB1B: The Infant-Directed Speech Preference in Bilingual Infants

Topic: Is the preference for infant-directed speech modulated by bilingual language exposure?

Leads: Krista Byers-Heinlein

Status: Stage 2 Registered Report under review. 

Links: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/zauhq/). [Data and Code on Github](https://github.com/manybabies/mb1b-analysis-public). [Listserv](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/manybabies-bilingual).

### MB1L: Longitudinal Vocabulary Followup

Topic: Followup study to MB1 measuring the relationship between infant-directed speech preference and later vocabulary.

Leads: Melanie Soderstrom

Status: Data collection ongoing.

Links: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/2qamd/). 

### MB1: Native Languages Follow-up Study

Topic: How does IDS preference to NA English in MB1 compare to IDS preference measured in non-English speaking babies’ native language?

Leads: Natalia Kartushina & Virginie Durier

Status: Stimulus creation and data collection.

Links: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/9j87t/)

### MB1: Test-Retest Followup

Topic: How reliable is the looking-time measure collected in MB1? 

Leads: Melanie Schreiner

Status: Final post-data collection manuscript preparation. 

Links: Contact leads for more information.

### MB1: Africa

Topic: Do infants growing up in a range of African nations show a preference for infant-directed speech?

Leads: Angeline Tsui, Casey Lew-Williams, Michael Frank

Status: Planning and training prior to data collection.

Links: Contact leads for more information.

### MB1: Other followups

* Comparison to meta-analytic data (leads: Christina Bergmann, Riccardo Fusaroli)
* Analysis of supplemental demographic variables (lead: Melissa Kline)

## MB2: Theory of Mind in Infancy

Topic: Do infants show anticipatory looking that reflects the false belief of another agent?

Leads: Hannes Rakoczy, Tobias Schuwerk, Dora Kampis, Michael Frank

Status: Stage 1 Registered Report under revision.

Links: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/jmuvd/). [Listserv](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/manybabies2).

## MB3: Rule Learning

Topic: Do infants learn and generalize identity-based rules from speech stimuli?

Leads: Ingmar Visser, Clartje Levelt

Status: Stimulus creation ongoing. 

Links: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/kqu9v/). [Listserv](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/manybabies3).

## MB4: Moral Evaluation

Topic: Do infants prefer agents who are seen to help over those who are seen to hinder?

Leads: Kelsey Lucca, Kiley Hamlin

Status: Pilot data collection complete.

Links: [Main Website](https://sites.google.com/view/manybabies4/home). [OSF Project](https://osf.io/xe2pj/). [Listserv](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/manybabies4).

## MB5: The Hunter & Ames model

Topic: What factors shape infants’ preferences for familiar and novel stimuli?

Leads: Jessica Kosie, Martin Zettersten, Christina Bergmann, and Casey Lew-Williams

Status: Nothing has happened yet. This summer, we'll send out a call for participation.


## ManyBabies-AtHome

Topic: Work towards solutions for testing infants in their home, with a focus on measuring looks. 

Leads: Helen Buckler, Lorijn Zaadnoordijk, Sho Tsuji, Christina Bergmann, Rhodri Cusack

Status: Planning and surveys of the community's needs and existing solutions, choosing a first collaborative study.
