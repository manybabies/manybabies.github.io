### MB1B: The Infant-Directed Speech Preference in Bilingual Infants

Topic: Is the preference for infant-directed speech modulated by bilingual language exposure?

Leads: Krista Byers-Heinlein

Status: Stage 2 Registered Report under review. 

Links: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/zauhq/). [Data and Code on Github](https://github.com/manybabies/mb1b-analysis-public). [Listserv](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/manybabies-bilingual).

### MB1L: Longitudinal Vocabulary Followup

Topic: Followup study to MB1 measuring the relationship between infant-directed speech preference and later vocabulary.

Leads: Melanie Soderstrom

Status: Data collection ongoing.

Links: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/2qamd/). 

### MB1: Native Languages Follow-up Study
