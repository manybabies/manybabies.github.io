### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, political perspective, status within the community, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by contributors include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities
The Governing Board, Executive Directory, and project leads are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The Governing Board, Executive Director, and project leads have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, emails, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (OSF, github, mailing lists) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event (e.g. during a conference presentation or at a meetup). Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by the Governing Board.

### Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the [ManyBabies Governing Board](mailto:manybabies-gb@mailman.stanford.edu), the [ManyBabies Executive Director](mailto:manybabies.director@gmail.com) or any of its members. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, ranging from discussion of these policies to expulsion from the group, including all mailing lists (either for a set time span or permanently). It is at the complainant’s discretion to pursue additional action through other legal or institutional mechanisms. The Governing Board and Executive Director are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. In cases of complaints directly to project leads, Governing Board members, or the Executive Director, the reporter's identity will be known only to those directly contacted by the complainant, unless the complainant’s explicit permission is obtained.

Governing Board members or project leads who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Boverning Board or project's leadership.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
