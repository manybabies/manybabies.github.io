  * [OSF - Open Psychological Datasets](https://osf.io/th8ew/)
* [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/): A globally distributed network of psychological science laboratories that coordinates data collection for democratically selected studies.
* [StudySwap](https://osf.io/meetings/StudySwap/): A platform for interlab replication, collaboration, and research resource exchange.
* [ManyPrimates](https://manyprimates.github.io/): A project that aims to facilitate collaboration across study sites in primate cognition research.
