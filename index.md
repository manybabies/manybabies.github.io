To-do:
- "sign up" page: create a Admnistrative Panel with Erin from PSA.
	- create the sign up/registration form
- open external links in new tabs? possible work around with kramdown - apply to all pages
- improve map (R): see "about"
- add a timestamp on each page, something like:
		https://tomkadwill.com/adding-last-modified-date-to-jekyll

Notes
- When using colors, use the color-blind palette from Wong (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618.pdf?origin=ppub)
	- logo and project placeholders follow it.

**ManyBabies (MB)** is a collaborative project for replication and best practices in developmental psychology research. Our goal is to bring researchers together to address difficult outstanding theoretical and methodological questions about the nature of early development and how it is studied. For example:

<!--- Do infants prefer agents who are seen to help over those who are seen to hinder?-->
- Do infants prefer helpers over hinderers?
<!--- What factors shape infants’ preferences for familiar and novel stimuli? -->
- When do infants like familiarity and when do they like novelty?
<!--How does Infant Direct Speech preference vary across age?-->
- Do babies find infant-directed speech (babytalk) more interesting than adult-directed speech?
