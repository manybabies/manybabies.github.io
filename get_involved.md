Everyone, from undergraduate students to senior researchers, who is interested in developmental research is welcome! You can contribute by:

1. *Planning and writing*: All steps and procedures, from literature review to data analyses, are defined in collaboration before the start of data collection (leading to [pre-registrations](https://www.cos.io/prereg) and/or [registred-reports](https://www.cos.io/rr)).
2. *Creating analyses, materials, and methods*: Adaptation and/or creation of methods, materials, and analyses are usually necessary (e.g., [MB-AtHome]({{site.baseurl}}/MB-athome/)).
3. *Collecting data*: Following standard research protocols. Which usually require adaptation of the labs' routine and staff training.

[Authorship]({{site.baseurl}}/authorship/) is granted to anyone who had a sustained intellectual contribution on any of these tasks. [Join the team today]({{site.baseurl}}/sign_up_log_in/) and/or get in touch with the [Governing Board](mailto:manybabies-gb@mailman.stanford.edu).
